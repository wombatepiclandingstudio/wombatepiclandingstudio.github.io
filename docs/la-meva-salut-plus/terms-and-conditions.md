# Terms And Conditions

## Introduction

Welcome to La Meva Salut Plus (the "Extension"), a Chrome Extension developed by Wombat Epic Landing Studio. Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using our Extension. By accessing or using the Extension, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please do not use the Extension.

## 1. Description of Service

The Extension is a tool designed for users of La Meva Salut (a health-related platform in Catalonia) to enhance their experience on the platform by providing additional features and functionality. The Extension is provided "as is" without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, whether now known or hereafter enacted, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose.

## 2. License and Restrictions

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, La Meva Salut Plus grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive license to use the Extension solely for its intended purposes as described in Section 1 above. You may not:

* Modify or create derivative works based on the Extension;
* Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Extension;
* Remove any proprietary notices or labels from the Extension;
* Rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer, or otherwise make available the Extension to any third party without our prior written consent.

## 3. Intellectual Property Rights
The Extension and all intellectual property rights therein are owned by Wombat Epic Landing Studio. The Extension may contain open-source software components subject to their respective licenses. You agree to abide by all such licenses. La Meva Salut Plus reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any feature or functionality of the Extension with or without notice.


## 4. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall Wombat Epic Landing Studio be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Extension, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total liability to you under these Terms shall not exceed $100 (one hundred dollars). The foregoing limitations will apply whether such damages arise out of breach of contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise and regardless of whether (i) we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and (ii) a remedy set forth in these Terms is found to have failed its essential purpose.

## 5. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Wombat Epic Landing Studio, our officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, and suppliers from and against all losses, expenses, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any violation of these Terms or any activity related to your use of the Extension (including negligent or wrongful conduct). We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.

## 6. Termination
We may terminate these Terms and your use of the Extension at any time for any reason or no reason. Upon such termination, you must immediately destroy all copies of the Extension in your possession or control. The provisions of Sections 1 (Description of Service), 3 (Intellectual Property Rights), 4 (Limitation of Liability), 5 (Indemnification), and 7 (Governing Law) will survive any termination of these Terms.

## 7. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed by the laws of SPain, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising under or related to these Terms shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Spain. You hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such dispute.

## 8. Miscellaneous
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and La Meva Salut Plus regarding your use of the Extension, superseding all prior or contemporaneous communications, whether electronic, oral, or written, between the parties concerning this subject matter. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure by either party to exercise at any time any right or require performance under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or requirement for any future event or circumstances.
