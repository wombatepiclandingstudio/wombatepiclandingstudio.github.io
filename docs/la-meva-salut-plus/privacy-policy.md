# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to La Meva Salut Plus (the "Extension"), a Chrome Extension developed by Wombat Epic Landing Studio. Please read Private Policy carefully before using our Extension. By accessing or using the Extension, you agree to be bound by our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, please do not use the Extension.

This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use it. This policy applies to all users of the Extension, regardless of where they are located.

## Collection and Use of Information

The Extension does not collect any personal data or user-specific information from its users. It is designed to function without accessing or transmitting any information. The only information that may be collected by:
- Google (as part of the Chrome Web Store) includes general usage statistics, which are anonymized and used for improving the Extension's performance and functionality.
- La Meva Salut, as per their [Legal Notice](https://lamevasalut.gencat.cat/es/web/cps/avis-legal).

## Sharing of Information

The Extension does not share your personal data with third parties or use it to serve targeted advertisements. The only exception is that:
- Google may collect anonymous usage statistics as part of their Chrome Web Store policies, which are subject to their own privacy policy.
- La Meva Salut, as per their [Legal Notice](https://lamevasalut.gencat.cat/es/web/cps/avis-legal)

## Security

The Extension relies on La Meva Salut eConsulta site for security. However, no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure, so while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
