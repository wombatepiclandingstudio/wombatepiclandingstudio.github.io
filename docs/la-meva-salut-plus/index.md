## What is La Meva Salut Plus?

La Meva Salut Plus is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the look and functionality of La Meva Salut's eConsulta feature, particularly on mobile devices.

**La Meva Salut** (https://lamevasalut.gencat.cat/), a platform for accessing Catalonia's Public Health Service, is constantly evolving with new features. However, eConsulta has remained largely unchanged with an outdated design.

As a frequent user of eConsulta, I found it increasingly cumbersome to use on mobile devices. This extension was born out of that frustration.

I hope La Meva Salut Plus improves your experience as well!

## How to Use La Meva Salut Plus

### tl;dr:

In desktop or Mac you are mostly fine, in mobile devices it's a bit tricky.

### A bit of context

If you use it from your computer, you just need a browser that supports Chrome extensions to use it.

But if you are using a mobile device, it's a bit more uncomfortable.

First of, you are more likely to use La Meva Salut app instead of a browser to access La Meva Salut. I can't do much with that fact.

You can, of course, use your browser - and it's practically the same experience. The kicker is that Chrome, the default browser for Android devices, _does not support chrome extensions_.

So you'll need another browser, with Chrome extensions support.
