## What is this about?

La Meva Salut Plus is a Chrome Extension to improve how La Meva Salut's eConsulta looks and works, specially for mobile devices.

[La Meva Salut](https://lamevasalut.gencat.cat/) is an application used to access the Public Health Service in Catalonia. They are putting a lot of effort in adding new features, but eConsulta has been left as it is, with a very old look and feel.

As I'm a power user of that feature, eConsulta, and it is near impossible to use in mobile devices, so I decided to create this extension.

I hope it's useful to you too!

## How can I use it?

### tl;dr:

In desktop you are mostly fine, in mobile devices it's a bit tricky.

### A bit of context

If you use it from your laptop, you just need a browser that supports Chrome extensions to use it.

But if you are using a mobile device, it's a bit more unconfortable.

First of, you are more likely to use La Meva Salut app instead of a browser to access La Meva Salut. I can't do much with that fact.

You can, of course, use your browser - and it's practically the same experience. The kicker is that Chrome, the default browser for Android devices, _does not support chrome extensions_.

So you'll need another browser, with Chrome extensions support.

### Compatible browsers

Although I don't recommend any browser in particullar, and I'm not being paid for advertising them, here's a list of browsers you can use.

The ones marked with a green check (✅) I have tested myself.

#### Desktop

- Chrome
- Edge ✅

#### Android

- Edge
- Kiwi ✅

#### iOS

- Vivaldi
- Opera

### OK, but how do I install it?

You just need to search for it in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/category/extensions).

Here's the direct link though: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meknghhlfdfipikogocccaclnegnbnnj
